Installer
=========

Nightly build installers are available for Linux and Mac OS and may be
downloaded from http://cci.lbl.gov/dials/installers/ and
http://dials.diamond.ac.uk/builds/.  Builds for Microsoft Windows are not
currently available, but will be added in the near future.

For instructions on compiling from source or setting up a DIALS development
environment, see :doc:`/documentation/installation_developer`.
