The field of structural biology by X-ray crystallography has benefitted
greatly from technological advances in recent years. Automation, highly
brilliant beamlines at 3rd generation synchrotron sources and high
frame-rate pixel array detectors have together enabled extremely rapid
collection of most MX datasets. In tandem, large area photon-counting
detection, microfocus beams and high quality X-ray optics have brought
more challenging projects within reach. At the cutting edge of this
technological advance, the demonstration of FEL nano-crystallography
offers the tantalizing prospect of a new era of structural biology at
large facilities, with a concomitant step change in data rates and
requirements for computationally intensive processing.

There is a clear need for new software for diffraction data analysis,
designed to cope with the ever increasing volumes and rates of data
collection, and with the developments in experimental methodology, from
shutterless, fine-sliced rotation scans through to the randomly-oriented
snapshots of serial crystallography. To keep up with these technological
advances it is to be expected that this new software would utilize
techniques of parallel processing using multiple CPU and GPU machines,
facilitating not just speed, but highly accurate analysis based on a
comprehensive physical model.
