DIALS Short Tutorial
====================

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a quick start guide to running DIALS for
integrating good quality synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. Many caveats apply
to this:

 - your mileage may vary etc. as the program is in development
 - we don't promise that the data are as good as from e.g. XDS
 - DIALS only does data processing you will need to use e.g. Aimless for
   the subsequent scaling

That said this tutorial illustrates that the program can work and give sensible
results.

Introduction
------------

The philosophy behind DIALS is to be explicit in performing the various steps
of data analysis rather than giving one big tool (though one big tool is
available) - DIALS is first and foremost a toolkit for doing the data analysis
to be used within other systems.

The workflow (if you do things step by step, which is recommended) is as 
follows:

 - import the data - this reads the image headers & makes sense of the data,
   forming sweeps etc. 
 - find spots - as it says on the tin, can adjust spot size
 - index - index these strong spots, can use a variety of methods
 - refine - refine the experimental geometry (included in indexing for 
   scan-static refinement)
 - integrate - actually integrate the data
 - export - create MTZ files

Some detail of the options for each of these will follow below. Hoe they are
used can be seen in tutorial.sh.
